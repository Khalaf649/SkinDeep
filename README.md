# Epidermal Wound Healing Model: Numerical Methods and Machine Learning

This project models epidermal wound healing using a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) that describes epithelial cell dynamics during wound closure. We implemented and compared various numerical methods ‚Äî including finite difference, finite element, and method of lines ‚Äî as well as machine learning approaches like supervised ML and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The study focuses on accuracy, computational efficiency, and potential clinical relevance.
